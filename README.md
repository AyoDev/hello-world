**Anime Sucks**
I wanted to do something unique for this blog.  I wanted to bash popular anime with my unique point of view.  I used to be a huge anime fan, but these days I’m a former angry anime fan, honestly anime sucks.

There’s one major flaw with anime that oddly enough is not addressed.  Basically 90%+ anime are based off manga that’s printed in weekly or monthly magazines.  The problem here is almost all anime end oddly (or a cliffhanger) or there are odd fillers in the main story.  The manga is also a spoiler for the anime, people who read the manga usually spoils it for the anime watching public as well.  So you are forced to read the manga to avoid spoilers and to catch up on the story, when you do that the anime sucks and doesn’t mean as much.

The style of anime these days has a very clean look.  There is no gritty element these days.  Everything is so sterile.  If you watch movies you notice the ever increasing presence of CG.  I feel this is happening to anime as well.  Anime sucks because the  animation looks wrong, too clean, you can tell a computer did it.

Another reason anime sucks, is the fan-service of the program.  Harem anime are overly saturated and the fan-service is ridiculous. Finding an anime you like these days is much more difficult.  The ratio from crap-good shows is increasing.  Out of hundred you’ll probably find ten of them that are of good quality.  The biggest problem is the manga connection to anime,  you are essentially dictated by the manga and if you go a different route the fans will ostracize you.

anime sucksI can’t count how many anime ends on a shitty ending or cliff hanger because of the manga crap.

I don’t know when my love starting to turn to hate, but it was a gradual process.  So now I’m here writing about why anime people love and I hate (or don’t like).  I never considered myself outside of the mainstream, but for some reason I am different.

I can’t understand the current anime culture, so I wanted to write about anime shows and why I think anime sucks.
